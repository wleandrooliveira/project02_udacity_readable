# Readable

Readable is my project for part 2 of Udacity's [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019): React & Redux

## The Challenge

> Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a “Readable” application where users can post text content and comment on each other's posts. You’ll build this dynamic application from scratch while combining the state management features of Redux with the declarative component model from React. When complete, you’ll be able to submit your own posts, comment on existing posts, and edit and delete posts and comments.

This React and Redux frontend application was started using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), uses a [backend server from Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) and the [Milligram](https://milligram.io/) CSS framework.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Clone or download the [backend server](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
3. Start the server as detailed in the server readme
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Backend Server

The app interacts with a [backend server from Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).
